Creating a simple online recipe book using HTML. This web page should allow users to view and explore recipes. Each recipe should have a title, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions. Create an HTML structure for the online recipe book. The structure should include the following elements: A heading at the top of the page, such as "My Recipe Book." A navigation menu with links to different recipes (e.g., "Pasta Carbonara," "Chocolate Chip Cookies," "Vegetable Stir-Fry"). A main content area where the selected recipe's details will be displayed. Each recipe should have a title, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions. Implement navigation so that when a user clicks on a recipe name in the navigation menu, the details of that recipe are displayed in the main content area.
